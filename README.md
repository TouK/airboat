CodeReview is a no-ceremony code review app, firstly developed during summer internships (2012) at TouK.

More on the conception behind the app can be read [here] (https://github.com/TouK/codereview/wiki/Wizja) (Polish only)

Any contributions (bug reports / feature requests / pull requests) are most welcome!
